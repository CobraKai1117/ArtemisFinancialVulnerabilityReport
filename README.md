# ArtemisFinancialVulnerabilityReport

***Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?***

Artemis Financial was a client for the company I worked with in this scenario, Global Rain. Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company, specializing in individual financial plans for savings/retirement and other forms of investment. They wanted Global Rain to help modernize the security to their web application.

***What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?***

With this project, I was able to convert the client's needs to security features that could be added to the application. I was also able to successfully identify what areas of the program needed improvement to its security. Having secure code helps a company's reputation and helps prevent cyberattacks that can cause serious damage to their systems.  


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Performing manual code reviews allowed me to get a better idea of where security vulnerabilities can occur in a program. It also generates ideas on how to protect these areas of the program. For example, in Artemis Financial's codebase, some of the libraries being used were outdated. This is a common issue with software security and a simple fix of updating the software can solve this issue. 

Performing static testing was challenging. The dependency check report was used to identify potential vulnerabilities in the program. While helpful, it was very comprehensive and technical. This made it difficult to separate the false positive results from the actual vulnerabilities. With enough time and experience it would provide greater benefits for security testing. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

To determine what layers of security need to be covered depends on the program requirements, program features and business needs of the company. Considering these factors allows a tester to determine potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. I started with a broad view of the program and began narrowing down my focus to specific areas of the program. By looking at the structure of the program, I determined the program needed to improve security through the use of input validation, secure communications protocol and encapsulating important data. Static testing and manual code reviews helped with this process tremendously.


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

This process was done through several iterations of security testing (both dynamic and static) as well as manual code reviews. While no program is completely secure performing these checks throughout the software development process can help mitigate many vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

As mentioned previously, dependency checks and manual code reviews helped tremendously. In future projects, these will be utilized to detect security vulnerabilities.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
